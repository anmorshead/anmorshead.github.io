🚀 My Portfolio Website

Hey! You found my digital playground! This is where I showcase my work, skills, and passion for front-end development. Built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Material UI, this site is as smooth as it is sleek. 

🎨 Tech Stack

⚛️ React – Because vanilla HTML is not a challenge.

🌊 Tailwind CSS – Making styling kinda fun?

🎭 Material UI – Google’s design team knows what’s good

🛠 Features

✅ Responsive Design – Looks stunning on desktops, tablets, and even tiny phone screens!
✅ Projects Showcase – All my best work, neatly displayed.

🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted a cool, modern, and interactive way to show off my projects and skills. Plus, building it was a great excuse to play with cool UI libraries and flex my front-end development skills.
